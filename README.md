# Python Todo Servers
If you've ever used a "RESTful" API and thought it would be awesome to create your own, you're in the right place. This project's goal is to show you how easy it can be to accomplish just that in [Python](http://www.python.org/) with the most popular libraries.

Inspired by the popular [TodoMVC](http://addyosmani.github.com/todomvc/), I would like to thank [Addy Osmani](https://github.com/addyosmani) for allowing me to use his interface utilizing the [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone) library. (My favorite...)

### Server Examples included:

- [web.py](http://webpy.org/) : (pip install web.py | easy&#95;install web.py)

## Data Storage

All of the servers in this project require [sqlite3](http://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html) library to be installed. 

## Starting the servers 

All of the servers can be located in their respective directories inside `./servers/`. Start the server by running the following command.

```
$ python main.py
http://0.0.0.0:8080/
```

browse to `http://localhost:8080` view the server in action.
